## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:

- **Node.js**: Version 18.0.0 or higher ([Download](https://nodejs.org/))
- **npm**: Version 9.0.0 or higher (comes with Node.js)

To check your installed versions:

```bash
node --version
npm --version
```

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone <repository-url>
cd simple-todo
```

2. Install dependencies:

```bash
npm install
```

This will install all dependencies for the root project and all workspace
packages.

## Development

To start the development servers for both the frontend and backend:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will start:

- **Frontend**: React app at http://localhost:3000 (with hot reload)
- **Backend**: Express API server at http://localhost:3001

You can verify the backend is running by visiting
http://localhost:3001/api/health

## Build

To create production builds:

```bash
npm run build
```

This will build both the frontend and backend applications.

## Testing

The project uses Jest for backend testing and Vitest for frontend testing, with
comprehensive unit and integration test coverage.

### Running Tests

Run all tests (backend + frontend):

```bash
npm test
```

Run backend tests only (Jest):

```bash
npm run test:server
```

Run frontend tests only (Vitest):

```bash
npm run test:web
```

Run tests in watch mode:

```bash
npm run test:watch
```

Generate coverage reports:

```bash
npm run test:coverage
```

### Coverage Requirements

The project maintains the following minimum coverage thresholds:

- **DataService**: 85%+ (critical for data integrity)
- **TaskService**: 80%+ (core business logic)
- **WIPLimitService**: 75%+ (WIP limit enforcement logic) - **Currently: 100%**
- **AnalyticsService**: 70%+ (behavioral metrics calculations) - **Currently: 95%**
- **Frontend Components**: 70%+ (UI components and flows)
- **Overall**: 70%+ for lines, functions, branches, and statements

Coverage reports are generated in:

- Backend: `apps/server/coverage/`
- Frontend: `apps/web/coverage/`

### Test Organization

**Backend Tests** (`apps/server/tests/`):

- Unit tests: `tests/unit/services/` - Service layer testing with mocked
  dependencies
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/api/` - API endpoint testing with real
  file I/O

**Frontend Tests** (`apps/web/tests/`):

- Component tests: `tests/unit/components/` - React component testing with React
  Testing Library
- Integration tests: `tests/integration/` - Full user flow testing with MSW for
  API mocking
- Accessibility tests: Automated a11y checks with jest-axe

### Continuous Integration

GitHub Actions runs all tests automatically on every push and pull request. The
CI pipeline:

- Runs linting and type checking
- Executes all tests with coverage
- Fails if any tests fail or coverage drops below thresholds

## Code Quality

### Linting

Check for linting errors:

```bash
npm run lint
```

Fix linting errors automatically:

```bash
npm run lint:fix
```

### Formatting

Format all files with Prettier:

```bash
npm run format
```

Check if files are formatted correctly:

```bash
npm run format:check
```

### Type Checking

Run TypeScript type checking:

```bash
npm run type-check
```

### Validate All

Run type checking, linting, and format checking:

```bash
npm run validate
```

## WIP Limit Feature

The Work In Progress (WIP) limit feature helps you maintain focus by limiting the number of active tasks you can work on simultaneously.

### Purpose

Research shows that limiting work in progress reduces context switching, improves focus, and increases completion rates. The WIP limit encourages finishing tasks before starting new ones.

### How to Configure

- **First Launch**: When you first open the app, you'll see a welcome screen where you can set your initial WIP limit (5-10 tasks)
- **Settings Modal**: Click the WIP count indicator or access Settings to adjust your limit at any time
- **Default Value**: 7 active tasks (recommended for optimal focus)

### Range

WIP limits are configurable between **5 and 10 active tasks**. This range is based on productivity research suggesting optimal focus occurs with 5-9 concurrent tasks.

### Helpful Messaging

When you reach your WIP limit:
- **Encouraging Tone**: Messages use supportive language like "maintain focus" instead of punitive phrases
- **Calming Design**: Soft colors and friendly icons (💡) create a positive experience
- **Guidance**: Messages include helpful context and a link to adjust your limit in Settings

### WIP Count Indicator

The real-time indicator in the UI header shows:
- **Current Status**: "X of Y active tasks" (e.g., "6 of 7 active tasks")
- **Color Coding**: Green when well below limit, yellow/orange when approaching limit, orange at limit
- **Interactive**: Click to open Settings and adjust your limit
- **Tooltip**: Hover for helpful context about WIP limits

## Analytics Capabilities

The analytics system provides rich behavioral data to help you understand your productivity patterns.

### Available Metrics

**Completion Rate**
- Percentage of tasks completed out of total tasks created
- Formula: (completed tasks / total tasks) × 100
- Helps track overall productivity trends

**Average Task Lifetime**
- Average time from task creation to completion
- Measured in milliseconds, can be formatted to hours/days
- Identifies if tasks are being completed promptly or aging

**Task Count by Status**
- Breakdown of active vs. completed tasks
- Format: `{ active: number, completed: number }`
- Quick snapshot of current workload

**Oldest Active Task**
- Identifies the task that has been active the longest
- Helps surface potentially forgotten or stuck tasks
- Useful for prioritization and cleanup

### How to Access

**For Epic 2 (MVP)**: Analytics are implemented as backend services but not yet exposed via API endpoints. The AnalyticsService provides all metrics with comprehensive test coverage (95%+).

**Phase 2**: Analytics API endpoints will be added:
- `GET /api/analytics/tasks` - Comprehensive task analytics (planned)

**Future Enhancement**: Visual dashboard with charts and trend analysis (planned for Epic 3+)

### Use Cases

- **Track Productivity**: Monitor completion rates over time
- **Identify Bottlenecks**: Find tasks aging without completion
- **Optimize Workflow**: Adjust WIP limits based on completion patterns
- **Data-Driven Insights**: Foundation for future intelligent prompting features

```

## Troubleshooting

### Port Already in Use

If you see an error that port 3000 or 3001 is already in use:

**On Windows:**

```bash
netstat -ano | findstr :3000
taskkill /PID <PID> /F
```

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
lsof -ti:3000 | xargs kill -9
lsof -ti:3001 | xargs kill -9
```

### Module Not Found Errors

If you encounter module not found errors:

1. Delete node_modules and package-lock.json:

   ```bash
   rm -rf node_modules package-lock.json apps/*/node_modules packages/*/node_modules
   ```

2. Reinstall dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

### TypeScript Errors

If you see TypeScript errors that don't make sense:

1. Clear TypeScript cache:

   ```bash
   rm -rf **/*.tsbuildinfo
   ```

2. Run type checking:
   ```bash
   npm run type-check
   ```

### Hot Reload Not Working

If changes aren't reflecting in the browser:

1. Check that the dev server is running
2. Try hard refresh in browser (Ctrl+Shift+R or Cmd+Shift+R)
3. Restart the dev server

## Contributing

1. Ensure all tests pass: `npm test`
2. Ensure code is linted: `npm run lint`
3. Ensure code is formatted: `npm run format`
4. Ensure TypeScript compiles: `npm run type-check`

Or run all checks at once:

```bash
npm run validate && npm test
```
