# Proactive Prompts

The app can gently remind you about tasks at regular intervals, helping you stay on track without being pushy.

**How Prompts Work:**
- The app checks your active tasks at intervals you set (default: every 4 hours)
- You'll see a notification suggesting a task you could work on
- You decide: Complete it now, dismiss the reminder, or snooze for later

**Responding to Prompts:**
- **Complete Now**: Opens the task and marks it as done
- **Dismiss**: Closes the prompt - you'll see another one at the next interval
- **Snooze**: Reminds you again in 1 hour

**Configuring Prompts:**
1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Find "Proactive Prompting" section
3. Toggle prompts on/off
4. Adjust frequency (1-8 hours between prompts)
5. Click Save

Prompts are designed to help, not harass. Turn them off anytime if they're not working for you.
