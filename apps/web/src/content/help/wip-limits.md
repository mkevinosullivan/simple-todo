# WIP Limits: Stay Focused

**What are WIP Limits?** WIP (Work In Progress) limits prevent you from having too many active tasks at once. Research shows that limiting your active tasks improves completion rates and reduces overwhelm.

**How it works:**
- You set a limit between 5-10 active tasks
- When you reach your limit, you must complete or delete a task before adding new ones
- The app shows encouraging messages to help you stay focused, not to punish you

**Adjusting your limit:**
1. Open Settings (gear icon)
2. Find "Work In Progress Limit"
3. Adjust the slider (5-10 tasks)
4. Click Save

**Recommended limit:** Most users find 7 tasks works well, but adjust based on your personal productivity style.
