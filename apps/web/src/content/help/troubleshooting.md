# Troubleshooting

Having issues? Here are solutions to common problems.

**My tasks aren't saving**
- Check that the app has permission to write to local storage
- Try refreshing the page - your tasks should reload
- If tasks are still missing, check browser console for errors (F12 → Console tab)

**Celebrations aren't appearing**
1. Open Settings → Check "Celebration Preferences"
2. Ensure celebrations are enabled (toggle should be ON)
3. Try clicking "Preview celebration" to test
4. Check browser console for JavaScript errors

**I can't add more tasks**
- You've hit your WIP (Work In Progress) limit
- Complete or delete a task to free up space
- Or adjust your limit in Settings (5-10 tasks allowed)

**Proactive prompts not appearing**
- Check Settings → Verify "Proactive Prompting" is enabled
- Ensure frequency is set appropriately (not too long)
- Browser may be blocking notifications - check browser permissions

**The app feels slow**
- Close and reopen the app to clear any memory issues
- Check if you have many tasks (100+) - consider archiving completed tasks
- Clear browser cache and reload
