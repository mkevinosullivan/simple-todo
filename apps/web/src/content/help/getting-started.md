# Getting Started

Welcome! This app helps you stay focused by managing your active tasks intelligently.

**The Basic Flow:**
1. **Add a task** - Type what needs to be done in the input field and press Enter
2. **Complete it** - Click the checkmark when you finish a task
3. **Get celebrated!** - You'll see an encouraging message to build momentum

**Key Features:**
- **WIP Limits**: We limit active tasks to prevent overwhelm (typically 5-10 tasks)
- **Celebrations**: Positive reinforcement when you complete tasks
- **Task Age Indicators**: Visual cues show which tasks have been waiting longest
