# Checklist Results Report

## Executive Summary

**Overall PRD Completeness:** 95%

**MVP Scope Appropriateness:** Just Right - The 4-epic structure balances delivering value with maintaining a tight 4-6 week timeline. Each epic builds logically on the previous while delivering independently valuable functionality.

**Readiness for Architecture Phase:** READY

**Most Critical Success Factors:**
- Comprehensive epic breakdown with 38 stories and ~380 acceptance criteria provides clear implementation roadmap
- Technical assumptions section gives architect clear constraints and technology decisions
- UX design goals refined through critical analysis ensure non-intrusive proactive prompting
- Strong alignment between Project Brief, PRD requirements, and epic stories
