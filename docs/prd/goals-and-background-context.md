# Goals and Background Context

## Goals
- Create a to-do application that prevents overwhelm through WIP limits and proactive engagement
- Transform task management from passive lists into an active productivity partner
- Validate the innovation hypothesis that proactive prompting increases task completion rates
- Demonstrate sophisticated behavioral design within a "simple" application context
- Build reusable data tracking infrastructure that supports future intelligent features
- Deliver functional MVP within 4-6 weeks suitable for pilot user testing

## Background Context

Traditional to-do applications are passive tools that wait for user discipline rather than providing active support. This creates a cycle of forgetting → accumulation → overwhelm → despair, particularly affecting chronic procrastinators and overwhelmed professionals. While competitors like Habitica, Todoist, and Things 3 have validated that celebration mechanics and focused views work, no successful product currently uses proactive prompting to break the passive engagement pattern.

This project reimagines task management through psychological design principles, combining proven approaches (WIP limits, celebration mechanics, data-driven insights) with one innovative differentiation: the app initiates interaction by intelligently prompting users to complete specific tasks. The Simple To-Do App aims to be an emotionally supportive accountability partner that prevents list bloat, celebrates progress, and proactively helps users complete what matters.
