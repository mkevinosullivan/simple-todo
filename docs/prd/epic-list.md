# Epic List

**Epic 1: Foundation & Core Task Management** Establish project infrastructure
(Node.js/TypeScript setup, Git, basic CI, Express server, React app scaffold)
and deliver basic task CRUD functionality with JSON storage. Users can add,
view, edit, delete, and complete tasks through a clean web interface.

**Epic 2: WIP Limits & Behavioral Tracking** Implement WIP limit enforcement
with helpful messaging and establish comprehensive data tracking infrastructure
(timestamps, task metadata, lifetime tracking). Users experience
constraint-based productivity and the system begins capturing behavioral data
for future intelligence.

**Epic 3: Celebration Mechanics & User Experience Polish** Add celebration
system with variety of messages, visual effects, and non-blocking presentation.
Implement task age visual indicators, empty states (quick start guide for new
users, inbox zero celebration for returning users), and first-launch
configuration flow.

**Epic 4: Proactive Prompting System** Build the innovation differentiator -
periodic task prompting with toast notifications, user response handling
(complete/dismiss/snooze), configurable prompting frequency, browser
notification opt-in, and the ability to disable prompting entirely.
