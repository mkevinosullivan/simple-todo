# Story 4.10: Testing, Epic Validation, and MVP Completion

<!-- Powered by BMAD™ Core -->

## Status

Draft

## Story

**As a** developer and product manager,
**I want** comprehensive testing of the prompting system and overall MVP validation,
**so that** we confirm the app is ready for pilot user testing and meets all PRD requirements.

## Acceptance Criteria

1. Unit tests for PromptingService verify: scheduling logic, task selection, configuration handling
2. Integration tests for SSE verify: connection establishment, event delivery, reconnection handling
3. Integration tests for prompt responses: complete action completes task, dismiss removes toast, snooze reschedules
4. Manual end-to-end testing checklist completed: receive prompt, test all response types, verify analytics tracking
5. Cross-feature testing: Prompt-triggered completion shows celebration, WIP limit respected, data tracked correctly
6. User acceptance criteria validation: All FR requirements (FR1-FR19) tested and working
7. Non-functional requirements validation: Startup time <2s, task operations <100ms, 70%+ test coverage achieved
8. Pilot user readiness: README with setup instructions, app runs cleanly on Windows/Mac/Linux, no critical bugs
9. Epic demo-able: Can demonstrate full user journey including receiving and responding to prompts
10. MVP complete: All 4 epics delivered, app ready for pilot user testing phase
11. Pilot users informed of feedback channels during onboarding

## Tasks / Subtasks

**Implementation Order:** Task 1 (PromptingService tests) → Task 2 (SSE integration tests) → Task 3 (prompt response tests) → Task 4 (cross-feature tests) → Task 5 (NFR validation) → Task 6 (manual E2E checklist) → Task 7 (pilot readiness) → Task 8 (demo preparation) → Task 9 (final validation)

- [x] **Task 1: Complete PromptingService Unit Tests** (AC: 1)
  - [x] Verify existing tests from Stories 4.1, 4.7, 4.8, 4.9 cover core functionality
    - [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md#Backend Unit Test]
  - [x] Ensure tests cover scheduling logic:
    - Scheduler starts when prompting enabled, stops when disabled
    - Respects configured frequency interval (2-3 hours default)
    - Pauses when no active tasks available
    - Tracks last prompt time for interval spacing
  - [x] Ensure tests cover task selection logic:
    - `selectTaskForPrompt()` chooses one active task randomly for MVP
    - Skips completed tasks
    - Returns null if no active tasks
  - [x] Ensure tests cover configuration handling:
    - Reads promptingEnabled and frequencyHours from config
    - Updates scheduler when config changes
    - Respects quiet hours if configured
  - [x] Ensure tests cover first prompt delay (Story 4.9):
    - 15-minute minimum delay from app startup
    - Subsequent prompts not affected by delay
  - [x] Ensure tests cover education and follow-up messaging (Story 4.9):
    - First prompt includes `isFirstPrompt: true` flag
    - Follow-up messages on second prompt based on response type
  - [x] Run coverage check: `npm run test:coverage -w @simple-todo/server`
    - Target: PromptingService ≥75% coverage (per architecture doc)
  - [x] Verify all edge cases covered:
    - App restart while prompt pending (N/A - handled by scheduler restart logic)
    - Config changes mid-cycle (tested via updatePromptingConfig)
    - Task deleted while scheduled for prompt (tested for snoozed prompts)
  - [x] Review test quality: clear test names, proper setup/teardown, meaningful assertions

- [x] **Task 2: Complete SSE Integration Tests** (AC: 2)
  - [x] Verify existing SSE tests from Story 4.2 cover core functionality
    - [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md#Backend Integration Test]
  - [x] Test SSE connection establishment:
    - `GET /api/prompts/stream` returns 200 with `text/event-stream` content-type
    - Connection headers include `Cache-Control: no-cache` and `Connection: keep-alive`
    - Client (EventSource) successfully connects to stream
  - [x] Test keep-alive messages:
    - Server sends keep-alive comment every 30 seconds
    - Prevents timeout on client side
    - Maintains connection during idle periods
  - [x] Test event delivery when prompt generated:
    - PromptingService emits 'prompt' event
    - SSE endpoint receives event and sends to client
    - Event format: `event: prompt\ndata: {taskId, taskText, promptedAt}\n\n`
    - Client EventSource receives and parses event correctly
  - [x] Test reconnection handling:
    - If connection drops, EventSource automatically reconnects (client-side browser behavior)
    - No duplicate events sent on reconnection (validated via concurrent connection tests)
    - Last-Event-ID header used for replay if needed (optional for MVP - not implemented)
  - [x] Test multiple browser tabs:
    - Each tab gets independent SSE connection
    - All tabs receive prompts independently
    - Closing tab properly terminates connection
  - [x] Test prompting disabled:
    - SSE endpoint returns 503 when `promptingEnabled: false` (cleaner than accepting with no events)
    - No prompt events sent when disabled
  - [x] Use supertest for HTTP assertions:
    - Mock PromptingService events to trigger prompt delivery
    - Assert event data format and content
    - [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md#Backend Integration Test]
  - [x] Run tests: `npm run test:integration -w @simple-todo/server -- prompts.test.ts`

- [x] **Task 3: Complete Prompt Response Integration Tests** (AC: 3)
  - [x] Verify existing tests from Story 4.4 cover response actions
    - [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md#Frontend Integration Test]

    - Click "Complete" button on PromptToast
    - Calls `PATCH /api/tasks/:id/complete` API
    - Task status updated to 'completed' in backend
    - Celebration overlay displays (Story 3.4 integration - tested in Task 4 cross-feature tests)
    - PromptToast disappears
    - Prompt response tracked in PromptEvent with type 'complete'
  - [x] Test "Dismiss" response:
    - Click "Dismiss" button on PromptToast
    - Toast disappears immediately
    - No API call to complete task
    - Prompt response tracked in PromptEvent with type 'dismiss'
    - No other side effects
  - [x] Test "Snooze" response:
    - Click "Snooze" button on PromptToast
    - Calls `POST /api/prompts/snooze` with taskId
    - Toast disappears
    - PromptingService schedules prompt for same task in 1 hour (backend logic tested in backend integration tests)
    - Prompt response tracked in PromptEvent with type 'snooze' (backend integration tests)
  - [x] Test snooze cancellation:
    - Snooze task A
    - Complete task A before snooze time
    - Verify scheduled prompt for task A is cancelled (backend logic tested in apps/server/tests/integration/api/prompts.test.ts lines 371-392)
  - [x] Test snooze cancellation on delete:
    - Snooze task B
    - Delete task B before snooze time
    - Verify scheduled prompt for task B is cancelled (backend logic tested in apps/server/tests/integration/api/prompts.test.ts lines 393-411)
  - [x] Test 24-hour duplicate prevention:
    - Receive prompt for task C
    - Dismiss prompt
    - Verify task C not prompted again within 24 hours (backend scheduling logic tested in apps/server/tests/integration/api/prompts.test.ts lines 347-369)
  - [x] Use React Testing Library + MSW for frontend tests:
    - Mock SSE connection to deliver test prompts
    - Mock API endpoints (task complete, prompt snooze)
    - Assert UI state changes and API calls
    - [Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md#Frontend Integration Test]

    - Verify PromptEvent recorded with response: 'complete' (verified via API call tracking)
    - Receive prompt, respond with "dismiss"
    - Verify PromptEvent recorded with response: 'dismiss' (verified via API call tracking)
    - Verify `GET /api/analytics/prompts` returns accurate statistics (backend API endpoint tested separately)
  - [x] Test WIP limit respected during prompting:
    - Have 3 active tasks (at limit)
    - Cannot create new task (blocked by WIP limit - Add Task button disabled)
    - Complete task via prompt
    - Verify can now create new task (WIP limit freed - Add Task button enabled)
  - [x] Test data integrity across features:
    - Complete task via prompt
    - Verify task status is 'completed'

    - Manually test task completion speed:
      - Complete task, measure time from click to celebration
      - Target: <100ms
    - Manually test task deletion:
      - Delete task, measure time from click to removal
      - Target: <100ms
    - Use browser DevTools Performance tab to measure

  - [ ] **NFR5: App Startup Time (<2 seconds)** - MANUAL VALIDATION REQUIRED
    - Stop backend: `Ctrl+C` to kill `npm run dev`
    - Start backend: `npm run dev -w @simple-todo/server`
    - Measure time from command to "Server listening on port 3001"
    - Target: <2 seconds to ready state
    - If >2s, check for slow file reads or dependency loading

### Architecture Context

**Testing Strategy Overview:**
This story focuses on validating the complete MVP, requiring comprehensive testing across all layers:
- **Backend Unit Tests:** Jest for service layer testing with mocked dependencies
- **Backend Integration Tests:** Jest + Supertest for API endpoint testing with real file I/O
- **Frontend Unit Tests:** Vitest + React Testing Library for component testing
- **Frontend Integration Tests:** Vitest + MSW for full flow testing with mocked APIs
- **Manual E2E Testing:** Manual checklist covering all user journeys
- **E2E Automation:** Playwright deferred to Phase 2 (per PRD)

[Source: docs/architecture/10-testing-strategy.md]

**Testing Pyramid Approach:**
- Heavy unit test coverage (fast, cheap) - ~100+ tests
- Moderate integration tests - ~30-50 tests
- Minimal E2E tests (manual for MVP, automated in Phase 2) - ~5-10 critical paths

**Coverage Requirements:**
Per PRD NFR8 and architecture document, minimum coverage targets:
- **TaskService:** 80%+ (core business logic)
- **WIPLimitService:** 75%+ (validation + messaging)
- **CelebrationService:** 70%+ (message rotation)
- **PromptingService:** 75%+ (scheduling logic)
- **AnalyticsService:** 70%+ (calculations)
- **DataService:** 85%+ (critical data integrity)

Coverage exclusions: Type definitions, configuration files, CSS

### Test Data Factories

Use factory functions for creating test data to avoid brittle tests with hardcoded values:

```typescript
// apps/server/tests/helpers/factories.ts
import { Task, TaskStatus } from '@simple-todo/shared/types';
import { v4 as uuidv4 } from 'uuid';

export function createTestTask(overrides: Partial<Task> = {}): Task {
  return {
    id: uuidv4(),
    text: 'Default test task',
    status: 'active' as TaskStatus,
    createdAt: new Date().toISOString(),
    completedAt: null,
    ...overrides,
  };
}

export function createTestConfig(overrides = {}) {
  return {
    wipLimit: 7,
    promptingEnabled: true,
    promptingFrequencyHours: 2.5,
    celebrationsEnabled: true,
    celebrationDurationSeconds: 7,
    ...overrides,
  };
}
```

- [ ] Commit message follows Conventional Commits

[Source: docs/architecture/13-coding-standards-conventions.md#Code Review Checklist]

### Performance Monitoring

**Measuring Task Operation Speed (<100ms NFR):**

1. **Browser DevTools Method:**
   - Open DevTools → Performance tab
   - Record performance while performing task operation
   - Analyze "Main" thread to find operation duration
   - Look for gaps between user click and UI update

2. **Console Timing Method (temporary code):**
   ```typescript
   // Frontend (temporary for performance testing)
   console.time('task-complete');
   await completeTask(taskId);
   console.timeEnd('task-complete'); // Should log <100ms
   ```

3. **Winston Logger Method (backend):**
   ```typescript
   // Backend service method
   const startTime = Date.now();
   await this.dataService.saveTasks(tasks);
   const duration = Date.now() - startTime;
   logger.debug(`Task save took ${duration}ms`);
   ```

**App Startup Measurement (<2s NFR):**
```bash
# Terminal timing
time npm run dev -w @simple-todo/server
# Output should show total time <2s to "Server listening on port 3001"
```

### Accessibility Testing Tools

**Automated Accessibility Testing:**
- Use jest-axe for component tests (already configured in Epic 3)
- Catches common WCAG violations (missing alt text, low contrast, etc.)

**Manual Accessibility Testing:**
- **Keyboard Navigation:** Tab, Shift+Tab, Enter, Space, Escape
- **Screen Reader:** NVDA (Windows free), VoiceOver (macOS built-in)
- **Color Contrast:** Use browser extension (e.g., axe DevTools) to check contrast ratios
- **Focus Indicators:** Verify visible focus outline on all interactive elements

[Source: docs/architecture/14-accessibility-implementation.md#Accessibility Testing Strategy]

### Integration Testing Patterns

**Backend Integration Test Example (Supertest):**
```typescript
import request from 'supertest';
import { app } from '../../../src/app';

describe('POST /api/tasks', () => {
  it('should create task and persist to file', async () => {
    const response = await request(app)
      .post('/api/tasks')
      .send({ text: 'Test task' })
      .expect(201);

    expect(response.body).toMatchObject({
      text: 'Test task',
      status: 'active',
    });
  });
});
```

**Frontend Integration Test Example (React Testing Library + MSW):**
```typescript
import { render, screen, fireEvent, waitFor } from '@testing-library/react';
import { rest } from 'msw';
import { setupServer } from 'msw/node';
import { App } from '../../src/App';

const server = setupServer(
  rest.get('/api/tasks', (req, res, ctx) => res(ctx.json([]))),
  rest.post('/api/tasks', (req, res, ctx) =>
    res(ctx.status(201), ctx.json({ id: '123', text: req.body.text }))
  )
);

beforeAll(() => server.listen());
afterAll(() => server.close());

test('should add task and display in list', async () => {
  render(<App />);

  fireEvent.change(screen.getByPlaceholderText(/what needs/i), {
    target: { value: 'Test task' }
  });
  fireEvent.click(screen.getByRole('button', { name: /add/i }));

  await waitFor(() => {
    expect(screen.getByText('Test task')).toBeInTheDocument();
  });
});
```
