# 1. Introduction

This document outlines the complete fullstack architecture for **Simple To-Do
App**, including backend systems, frontend implementation, and their
integration. It serves as the single source of truth for AI-driven development,
ensuring consistency across the entire technology stack.

This unified approach combines what would traditionally be separate backend and
frontend architecture documents, streamlining the development process for modern
fullstack applications where these concerns are increasingly intertwined.

## Starter Template or Existing Project

**N/A - Greenfield project**

The Simple To-Do App is a greenfield development with no starter template or
existing codebase. The architecture will be designed from scratch based on PRD
requirements and technical assumptions (Node.js/TypeScript monolith, Express +
React, JSON file storage for MVP).
