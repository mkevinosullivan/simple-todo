    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security-sensitive operations. Client-side validation only, server validation already exists from previous stories.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent performance optimization: no polling (saves 720+ requests/hour), local filtering O(n) acceptable for MVP scale, optimistic updates reduce latency.'
  reliability:

    notes: 'Comprehensive error handling with rollback mechanisms. Loading states prevent duplicate operations.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Well-documented code with JSDoc, clear component boundaries, comprehensive tests enable safe refactoring, CSS modules prevent style conflicts.'
