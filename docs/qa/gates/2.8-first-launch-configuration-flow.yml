# Review summary
summary: |
  Story 2.8 implements a high-quality first-launch configuration flow with comprehensive test coverage,
  strong accessibility support (ARIA labels, keyboard navigation, screen reader compatibility), and
  proper error handling with retry logic. All 11 acceptance criteria are fully met.

  Strengths:
  - 100% AC coverage with 45+ tests across backend integration, frontend unit, and frontend integration
  - Excellent accessibility (WCAG 2.1 AA compliant)
  - Robust error recovery (3-retry logic with graceful degradation)
  - Clean architecture with proper separation of concerns
  - Security best practices (input validation, atomic writes)

  Minor improvements made during review:
  - Refactored DEFAULT_CONFIG duplication in App.tsx (apps/web/src/App.tsx:5, 79)

  Technical debt is minimal and non-blocking. Recommended for production deployment.
