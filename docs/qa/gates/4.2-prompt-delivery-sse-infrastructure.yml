# Required fields
schema: 1
story: '4.2'
story_title: 'Prompt Delivery - Server-Sent Events (SSE) Infrastructure'
gate: CONCERNS
status_reason: 'Solid SSE implementation with comprehensive tests. Identified and fixed DataService instantiation issue. Minor performance testing gap remains for production readiness.'
reviewer: 'Quinn (Test Architect)'
updated: '2026-02-05T00:00:00Z'

# Waiver status
waiver: { active: false }

# Issues identified during review
top_issues:
  - id: "PERF-001"
    severity: medium
    finding: "DataService instantiation per SSE connection creates unnecessary overhead"
    suggested_action: "Use shared dataService instance from services/index.ts"
    status: "FIXED - Refactored to use shared instance"

  - id: "TEST-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No performance benchmarks or load tests for SSE connections"
    suggested_action: "Add performance tests to validate AC 10 (minimal resource usage)"
    status: "DEFERRED - Acceptable for MVP, recommend before production scale-up"

  - id: "ARCH-001"
    severity: low
    finding: "No connection timeout or max connection duration limit"
    suggested_action: "Consider adding configurable max connection time for production"
    status: "DEFERRED - Acceptable for MVP single-user localhost deployment"

# Risk summary
risk_summary:
  totals: { critical: 0, high: 0, medium: 1, low: 2 }
  recommendations:
    must_fix:
      - "PERF-001 fixed during review - use shared dataService instance"
    monitor:
      - "Consider performance benchmarks before production deployment"
      - "Monitor connection count and resource usage in production"

# NFR validation
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: "No authentication required for localhost MVP. JSON serialization prevents injection. Prompting can be disabled via config."

  performance:
    status: CONCERNS
    notes: "DataService instantiation issue fixed. Event-driven architecture is efficient. Missing: performance benchmarks and load tests for AC 10 validation."

  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Automatic reconnection via EventSource. Graceful degradation for unsupported browsers. Comprehensive error handling and cleanup."

  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: "Excellent documentation with JSDoc. Clear code structure. Named constants. Type-safe implementation. Well-organized tests."
