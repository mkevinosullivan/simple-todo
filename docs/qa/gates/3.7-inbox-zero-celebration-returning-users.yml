# NFR validation results
nfr_validation:
  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Analytics endpoint properly uses existing service layer. No user input handling in new components beyond button clicks.'
  performance:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Analytics fetch with graceful degradation on failure. Confetti library lazy-loaded. CSS animations use GPU-accelerated properties (transform, opacity).'
  reliability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Excellent error handling with graceful degradation. Analytics API failure does not prevent celebration display.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Clean separation of concerns. Well-documented with JSDoc. Follows established patterns from previous stories.'
