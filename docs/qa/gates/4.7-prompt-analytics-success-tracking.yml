notes: |
  This story demonstrates exceptional software engineering quality:

  **Test Coverage Highlights:**
  - 70+ unit tests for AnalyticsService covering all methods and edge cases
  - Comprehensive integration tests for GET /api/analytics/prompts endpoint (lines 124-270)
  - Full frontend component test suite for SettingsModal analytics section
  - All edge cases covered: zero values, null data, timeout handling, error scenarios

  **Code Quality Highlights:**
  - Full TypeScript type safety with no 'any' types
  - Comprehensive JSDoc documentation with examples on all public methods
  - Service layer pattern followed precisely with constructor injection
  - Privacy-first design fully implemented (local storage only, no telemetry)
  - Atomic file writes prevent data corruption

  **Previous CONCERNS Fully Resolved:**
  - TEST-001: Integration test for /api/analytics/prompts ✅ COMPLETED
  - TEST-002: Frontend tests for analytics display ✅ COMPLETED

  **Production Readiness:** This implementation is production-ready with high confidence. All acceptance criteria met, comprehensive test coverage, and excellent code quality.
