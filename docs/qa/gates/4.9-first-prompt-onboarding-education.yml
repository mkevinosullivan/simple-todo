  security:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'No security concerns. Education flags are user preferences with no security implications.'
  performance:
    status: PASS

    status: PASS
    notes: 'AC 5 violation fixed. Education dismissal works correctly on any first prompt interaction.'
  maintainability:
    status: PASS
    notes: 'Code is well-structured with clear separation of concerns. JSDoc comments present. Good type safety.'

  future:
    - action: 'Consider adding integration test file PromptEducationFlow.test.tsx to verify end-to-end education workflow'
      refs: ['apps/web/tests/integration/']
      rationale: 'Would improve confidence in full user flow testing. Current unit test coverage is adequate but integration tests provide additional assurance. Optional enhancement, non-blocking.'

    - action: 'Consider checkbox label clarity improvement (optional UX enhancement)'
      refs: ['apps/web/src/components/PromptToast.tsx:145']
      rationale: 'Current label "Got it, don\'t show this again" is acceptable. Alternative "Don\'t show this tip right now" may be clearer about timing. Optional UX polish, non-blocking.'
